# Specification Quality Checklist: Dynamic Group Call Screen

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-07-09  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass. Specification is ready for `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- The spec intentionally mentions `easy_localization` as a user-facing constraint (localization requirement), not as an implementation detail — it defines WHAT the user requires (localized text), not HOW to build it.
- Mock data requirement (`List<CallParticipant>`) is included as a scope boundary, not an implementation directive — it communicates that no live backend is needed.
